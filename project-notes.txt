ISSUES TO FIX:

1âœ…) onAddItemSubmit() [line 19]
    How its supposed to work: If form is submitted with no text an alert MSG appears and then after clicking "Ok" should return to text field. Nothing is added to DOM or to localStorage.
    
    What's actually happenning: alert MSG appears then after "Ok", an empty list item is added to the DOM (though not added to localStorage).

    SOLVED! Validation within onAddItemSubmit() in unnecessary. Validation with alert placed within addItemToDOM() after creation of li element and textNode. Validation at top of addItemToStorage() prevents localStorage - no alert is needed here. Also added validation with alert When updating a list item, if user fails to type any text, alert will appear and isEditMode will remain on until text is entered.

2) checkIfItemExists() [line 127] 
    Function does not consider case. Compares exact match only.
    IDEAS: RegEx should fix this.

============================================
TO DO LIST:
-----------

1) [LINE 91] for item editing, add pen icon to left of delete icon, refactor code for "Create new button" and "Create new x icon"
innerHTML = '<i class="fa-solid fa-pen"></i>';

2) Give color to the "Clear All" button

3) Ability to re-oder the list items and have it persist in localStorage

============================================
Culled code
